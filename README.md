## what it is about

at work i had the task to mentor an intern into making a real-time dart application for our team.
while teaching him vue and quasar among other things, i wasn't really content with the way we went about the whole project.

therefore i wanted to give it my own spin, using go instead of pocketbase and nuxt instead of quasar for the frontend.
the real-time functionality will, at least so i think, be implemented using web sockets
